Frontend (JavaScript)
→ Collect game state and send it to backend (PHP) using AJAX (fetch).

Backend (PHP)
→ Receive the data and insert it into your MySQL database.

Database (MySQL via phpMyAdmin)
→ Store the game data (player name, score, level, etc.).






Basic Flow for Saving Game State
Frontend: Your game collects the current state 
(like score, level, inventory) 
and sends it via an AJAX request to the backend (PHP).

Backend (PHP): The PHP script receives the game state data, 
validates it, 
then stores it into your SQL database.

Load state: When the player opens the game again, 
the frontend requests the saved state from the backend, 
which reads from the database and returns the state for the game to resume.
